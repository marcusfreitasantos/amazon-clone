# Amazon Clone

The goal of this project was made a clone from Amazon website using React.JS and Firebase.

## About the project

This project has some pages from Amazon website and the photos and data of the products I got from them. The goal was use React.JS for the front-end and Google Firebase for the back-end and also user authentication. With this I could learn some concepts about deployment, cloud, firebase and how to integrate React with remote database.
